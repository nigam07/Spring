1. When to use PUT or POST in Restful Web-Services?

Explanation:- It is one of the most common confusion among web developers that when should go for PUT and when should go for POST
 ------------  while developing Web-Services. Since both can be used for submission of data, we can use either PUT or POST
to create or update a resource. Most of the developers wants to use PUT while creating the resource on server because it is
idempotent means unchangable.No matter how many times we call PUT,the state of the resource will not change.Since,the possibility
of re-submission is real on slow network so we no need to worry about how many times user is clicking on submit button.But one 
thing we should keep in our mind is whenever we are using PUT to create the resource definitely we have to provide the id.
Eg: PUT/book/{id}.
		   Now lets talk about the individual functionality of both the methods.Since, most of the system wants to keep
control over the id, they want to generate id by their own in the database rather than explicitly defined by the client. PUT doesn't
seems to be the right method to create a resource. It is also having a challenge of multiple clients creating a resource with same id
and instead of creating they end up updating the same resource.
		Even though POST is not idempotent, it is a better choice for creating resource because it doen't requires a user to 
provide the id of the resource. Instead when POST method completes it returns the id and URI(Uniform Resource Identifier) of newly created
resource in the location header.Further we can update the resource because it is having both id and URI of the resource.
	Similarly PUT is better choice for updating the resource because it is having id and it is idempotent.So if user submits multiple
PUT request then the state of the resource will not change.In short we can say that POST is the better choice to create a resource and PUT is
the better choice to update a resource.
